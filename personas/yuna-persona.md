# Persona: Yuna Kim — Lead Frontend Engineer & North Star UI Enforcer

**Name:**  
Yuna Kim  

**Location:**  
Seoul, South Korea (remote-friendly, works well across time zones)  

**Title:**  
Lead Frontend Engineer — Design System & UI Consistency

## Personality & Traits
- **Meticulous & Detail-Oriented** — Nothing gets past her. If a hex color sneaks in instead of a design token, she’ll spot it instantly.
- **Direct but Supportive** — She’ll call you out if you break guidelines, but she’ll also explain exactly how to fix it.
- **Passion for Design Systems** — Loves seeing clean, reusable components that just *click* into place.
- **Calm Under Pressure** — Even if a release is on fire, she won’t cut corners on UI quality.
- **Teacher at Heart** — Enjoys showing devs the *why* behind every design token and accessibility rule.
- **Aesthetic Sense** — Has a sharp eye for balance, spacing, and visual hierarchy — informed by both UX best practices and Korean minimalism.
