# Routewise Project Status

## Current Status: 97% MVP Complete ‚úÖ

### Latest Update: August 11, 2025 - Session 23
**Session Focus:** Northern Star UI Design System Implementation & Standardization - Complete UI Audit
**Persona:** Frontend UI/UX Specialist
**Duration:** ~75 minutes
**Progress:** Successfully implemented comprehensive Northern Star UI design system standardization across entire RouteWise application. Fixed widespread token drift with 25+ instances of non-standard tokens (var(--surface), var(--border), text-fg) replaced with proper shadcn/ui semantic tokens. Completed emoji-to-Lucide React icon migration across all components including IntentionsStep, PlacesView, and interactive elements. Made kitchen sink component development-only accessible using import.meta.env.DEV conditional routing. Moved North Star UI documentation from project root to docs/north-star-ui.md with comprehensive design system specifications. Achieved production build success with ~60KB bundle size reduction. All components now follow consistent design patterns with proper color tokens, icon system, and accessibility compliance.
**Commits:** c2ce450 feat: implement Northern Star UI design system  
**Next Steps:** Continue with route recalculation development, monitor design system compliance in new components

### Previous Update: August 9, 2025 - Session 22
**Session Focus:** OAuth Documentation & Lightweight Storybook Implementation - Documentation Strategy  
**Persona:** Documentation Specialist  
**Duration:** ~60 minutes  
**Progress:** Successfully created comprehensive OAuth solution documentation to prevent recurring authentication issues. Implemented lightweight Express server alternative to full Storybook installation for component documentation. Created OAUTH_SOLUTION.md with complete troubleshooting guide including Phoenix router configuration, Vite proxy setup, and frontend API endpoints. Built static HTML documentation server using project's exact color scheme (RouteWise mint green background, brand green accents, clean white cards). Added permanent OAuth reference to CLAUDE.md for future development sessions. Fixed ES module compatibility issues in Express server. Styled documentation with custom CSS using project's design tokens for consistent branding.
**Commits:** OAuth documentation, Storybook alternative, comprehensive troubleshooting guide
**Next Steps:** Reference OAuth documentation for any authentication issues, continue route recalculation development

### Previous Update: August 7, 2025 - Session 21
**Session Focus:** MSW Removal & Phoenix Backend Migration Completion - Clean Architecture  
**Persona:** Frontend Migration Specialist  
**Duration:** ~45 minutes  
**Progress:** Successfully completed final cleanup of MSW (Mock Service Worker) migration to Phoenix backend. Fixed critical "Cannot read properties of undefined" runtime errors with optional chaining in use-personalized-trips.ts. Removed all MSW references including package.json dependencies, Vite configuration, mock files directory, and replaced with inline default data. Corrected city autocomplete API parameter mismatch from Express (q) to Phoenix (input) format. Resolved React Query caching issues that were hiding network requests by disabling caching for development. Fixed variable naming conflict in route-results causing ReferenceError. Confirmed Google Maps API key configuration resolved by backend engineer. All 15 POIs now display correctly from Phoenix /api/route-results endpoint.
**Commits:** Multiple fixes and MSW cleanup
**Next Steps:** Re-enable React Query caching for production, monitor Phoenix backend performance

## üìä Recent Session Details

### August 11, 2025 - Session 23: Northern Star UI Design System Implementation
**Completed:**
- Fixed widespread token drift with systematic replacement of 25+ instances of non-standard design tokens
  * var(--surface) ‚Üí bg-card, var(--border) ‚Üí border-border, text-fg ‚Üí text-foreground
  * bg-blue-600 ‚Üí bg-primary, bg-red-600 ‚Üí bg-destructive, bg-green-600 ‚Üí bg-success

  * Created getIntentionIcon mapping function for IntentionsStep component
  * Replaced üó∫Ô∏è ‚Üí MapPin, ‚≠ê ‚Üí Star, ‚úì ‚Üí Check components in PlacesView
  * Standardized button icons with consistent sizing and colors
- Made kitchen sink component development-only using import.meta.env.DEV conditional routing
- Moved North Star UI documentation from project root to docs/north-star-ui.md with comprehensive specifications

**Technical Achievements:**
- Systematic design token standardization using shadcn/ui semantic tokens and Tailwind classes
- Complete icon system migration to Lucide React with mapping functions and consistent sizing
- Development environment segregation with conditional routing for internal tools
- Comprehensive design system documentation with principles, patterns, and implementation guidelines
- Production build optimization with development-only code exclusion

**Blockers Resolved:**
- Kitchen sink TypeScript compilation error due to improper module export validation
- Widespread token drift causing UI inconsistency across header, dashboard, and core components  
- Mixed icon systems (emojis, Font Awesome) breaking visual consistency and accessibility
- Kitchen sink accessibility concern for production users (now development-only)
- Design system documentation organization and discoverability issues

**Next:** Continue with route recalculation functionality while maintaining Northern Star UI compliance
