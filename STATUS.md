## üõ† Technical Architecture

### Backend APIs ‚úÖ
- **Google Places API** - POI search by location/route
- **Google Directions API** - Route calculation and polylines  
- **Express Routes** - `/api/pois`, `/api/route`, `/api/maps-key`
- **Database** - PostgreSQL with persistent storage

### Frontend Components ‚úÖ
- **Route Form** - City input with validation
- **POI Cards** - Display with ratings, photos, descriptions
- **Results Page** - Route and POI display
- **shadcn/ui** - Complete component library

### Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- **Docker Compose** - Dev environment with hot reload
- **TypeScript** - Full-stack type safety
- **Environment Config** - API keys and database properly configured

## üéØ Next Session Goals

### Priority 1: Route Recalculation Functionality
- Implement "Update Route" button functionality in enhanced itinerary component
- Connect POI selection to route recalculation backend endpoint
- Add real-time route updates when POIs are added/removed

### Priority 2: Performance & Cost Optimization
- Implement API response caching (Redis or in-memory)
- Add API usage monitoring and cost tracking
- Optimize Google API calls to reduce costs

### Priority 3: Production Readiness
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Railway deployment configuration
- Performance monitoring setup

## üìä Session History

### July 30, 2025 - Session 2: Enhanced Itinerary & Google API Integration
**Completed:**
- Enhanced itinerary component with real Google Directions API integration
- Interactive POI selection with checkboxes and real-time updates
- Google Cloud billing resolution (payment method switch)
- JSX syntax error fixes (escaped quotes in className)
- Complete POI architecture explanation and documentation
- Route overview display with actual distance and duration
- Smart POI positioning along calculated routes

**Blockers Resolved:**
- Google Cloud billing issues with payment methods
- JSX pre-transform errors in TypeScript components
- POI integration strategy and data flow understanding

**Next:** Route recalculation functionality and performance optimization

### July 30, 2025 - Session 1: Google API Integration
**Completed:**
- Google Directions API service implementation
- Route calculation endpoint (`/api/route`)
- API key configuration and verification
- Real Google data integration

**Blockers Resolved:**
- Environment variable configuration in Docker
- Google API service architecture

**Next:** Frontend map visualization and itinerary display

---

## üêõ Known Issues
- No current blocking issues
- API rate limiting not implemented (monitor costs)
- Error handling could be more robust

## üí° Technical Debt
- Large hardcoded city coordinates list should be externalized
- Google Places service class getting large - needs refactoring
- No test suite implemented yet
