## Test Checklist

### âœ… Token Management
- [ ] Check browser console - no token errors
- [ ] Check localStorage - Google user and token stored
- [ ] Navigate between pages - auth state persists
- [ ] Refresh page - user remains logged in

### âœ… API Integration
- [ ] API calls include Google ID token in Authorization header
