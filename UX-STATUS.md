## üìã Completed UX Improvements

### 1. Header Simplification & Cleanup
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed & Deployed
**PR:** #4 - feat: enhance header and trip wizard UX

#### Changes Made:
- **Logo Simplification**: Removed logo image, kept "RouteWise" text only for cleaner design
- **Authentication Streamlining**: Removed Login button from home page, kept Sign Up only
- **Responsive Consistency**: Logo text now shows on all screen sizes

#### User Experience Impact:
- Cleaner, more focused header design
- Reduced cognitive load with fewer authentication options
- Consistent branding across all screen sizes
- Improved visual hierarchy

#### Files Modified:
- `client/src/components/header.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/home.tsx`

### 2. Trip Wizard UX Standardization
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed & Deployed
**PR:** #4 - feat: enhance header and trip wizard UX

#### Problem Identified:
- Inconsistent card selection behavior across wizard steps
- Step 5 (Lodging): Green border + title, white background ‚úÖ Good UX
- Step 6 (Intentions): Full green background + white text ‚ùå Poor contrast
- Confusing terminology: "Intentions" vs "Interests"

#### Solution Implemented:
- **Consistent Card Styling**: Fixed Interests step to match Lodging step behavior
  - Green borders (`border-primary`) when selected
  - Green titles (`text-primary`) when selected  
  - White background with subtle tint (`bg-primary/5`)
  - Removed full green background with white text
- **Improved Labeling**: Renamed "Intentions" to "Interests" for clarity
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Added "Select All" button for better user control

#### User Experience Impact:
- Consistent interaction patterns across all wizard steps
- Better visual feedback with improved contrast ratios
- Clearer terminology that users understand intuitively
- More efficient selection with "Select All" functionality
- Maintained accessibility with proper focus states

#### Files Modified:
- `client/src/lib/trip-wizard/wizard-utils.ts` - Step titles
- `client/src/components/trip-wizard/components/steps/IntentionsStep.tsx` - Component logic & styling

### 3. North Star UI Design System Compliance
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented Throughout

#### Design System Adherence:
- **Color Tokens**: Used `--primary`, `--border`, `--foreground` consistently
- **Spacing**: Applied 4px spacing multiples (`gap-2`, `px-4`, etc.)
- **Focus States**: Implemented proper `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring` patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with appropriate breakpoints
- **Component Patterns**: Followed shadcn/ui conventions throughout

#### Accessibility Improvements:
- Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Screen reader announcements for state changes

4. **Yellowstone National Park** - 6-day geysers and wildlife
5. **Grand Canyon National Park** - 4-day canyon exploration

#### API Endpoints Planned:
```elixir
# Core suggested trips endpoints (NEW - High Priority)
GET /api/suggested-trips              # Dashboard hero carousel
GET /api/suggested-trips/:slug        # Detailed trip pages  
GET /api/suggested-trips/featured     # Homepage featured section
GET /api/suggested-trips/:slug/places # Mapping integration
GET /api/suggested-trips/:slug/itinerary # Day-by-day planning

# Existing endpoints (Already implemented)
GET /api/places/autocomplete          # Place search
GET /api/route-results               # Route planning with POIs
GET /api/trips                       # User's saved trips
GET /api/auth/google                 # OAuth authentication
```

#### Implementation Artifacts:
- **Database Seed Script**: `/Users/urielmaldonado/projects/refactor/pages/database_seed.sql`
- **Complete with**: PostgreSQL schema, data inserts, indexes, views
- **Ready for Phoenix backend integration**
