# MSW Integration Test Instructions

## Testing the `/api/health` MSW Mock

To test if MSW is working correctly:

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/route-wise/frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser developer tools** and look for these console messages:
   ```
   🚀 MSW: Mock Service Worker started successfully
   📡 MSW: Intercepting API requests for development
   ```

3. **Test the health endpoint** by making a request:
   - Open browser developer tools → Network tab
   - Navigate to your app
   - Look for `/api/health` requests
   - You should see MSW console logs: `🔍 MSW: Intercepted /api/health request`

4. **Expected response:**
   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "timestamp": "2025-08-01T...",
     "services": {
       "nominatim": "available",
       "googlePlaces": "available", 
       "googleMaps": "available"
     }
   }
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- If MSW doesn't start, check that `mockServiceWorker.js` exists in `client/public/`
- If requests aren't intercepted, check browser console for service worker errors
- Network requests should show "from ServiceWorker" in DevTools Network tab

## What's Implemented

✅ **MSW Browser Setup** - Service worker integration
✅ **Health Check Mock** - `/api/health` endpoint  
✅ **Maps Key Mock** - `/api/maps-key` endpoint
✅ **Autocomplete Mocks** - Both free and premium city search
✅ **POI Mocks** - Points of interest with route/checkpoint logic
✅ **Realistic Data** - Generated POIs with proper categories, ratings, images

## Next Steps

Ready to test specific endpoints one by one. Let me know if you want to:
1. Test the current implementation
2. Focus on a specific endpoint
3. Add more sophisticated mock data
4. Handle edge cases and error scenarios
